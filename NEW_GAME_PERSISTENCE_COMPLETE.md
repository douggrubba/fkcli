# New Game Creation & State Persistence - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Team Selection for New Game**
- After selecting "New Game" from the menu, players see a team selection screen
- Lists all available teams sorted alphabetically by city and name
- Simple navigation with arrow keys and Enter to select
- Clean UI showing city and team name

### 2. **Game State Persistence**
- Every screen change is automatically saved to the database
- Game remembers exactly where the player left off
- When restarting the app, players resume at their last screen
- No data loss between sessions

### 3. **Enhanced Menu System**
- "Continue" option only shows if there's a saved game
- "New Game" properly cleans up any existing save before starting fresh
- Seamless navigation between all screens

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_saves (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    save_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    player_team_id INTEGER,
    current_screen TEXT DEFAULT 'menu',
    game_data TEXT, -- JSON for flexible game state
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 0 -- Only one active save at a time
);
```

### New Components Created
1. **TeamSelectionScreen.js** - Team selection UI
2. **GameScreen.js** - Main game management screen
3. **gameState.js** - Game state management singleton

### Key Classes & Methods

#### GameDatabase Extensions
- `createNewGame(playerTeamId, saveName)` - Create new game save
- `getActiveGame()` - Get current active game
- `updateGameState(screen, data)` - Persist screen changes
- `hasActiveGame()` - Check for existing saves
- `deleteActiveGame()` - Clean up saves

#### GameState Manager
- `initialize()` - Load saved state on startup
- `setCurrentScreen(screen, data)` - Update and persist screen changes
- `getPlayerTeam()` - Get player's selected team
- `createNewGame(teamId, saveName)` - Start new game

## 🎮 User Flow

### Starting New Game
1. **Main Menu** → Select "New Game"
2. **Team Selection** → Choose your team from the list
3. **Game Screen** → Begin managing your selected team
4. **State Saved** → Every navigation is automatically persisted

### Resuming Game
1. **App Restart** → Automatically resumes at last screen
2. **Menu Shows Continue** → Option appears if saved game exists
3. **Seamless Resume** → No setup required, pick up where you left off

### Game Management
- View current team record and stadium information
- Season progress tracking (day, year, etc.)
- Clean navigation back to menu (with state persistence)

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Automatic State Persistence
```javascript
// Every screen change automatically persists
const gameState = getGameState();
gameState.setCurrentScreen('teams', { additionalData: 'here' });
```

### Resume on Startup
```javascript
// App automatically checks for saved game on startup
const existingGame = initializeGameState();
if (existingGame) {
    setCurrentScreen(existingGame.current_screen); // Resume exactly where left off
}
```

### Smart Menu Display
```javascript
// Continue option only shows when there's a saved game
const menuItems = [
    { key: 'newGame', label: 'New Game' },
    ...(hasSavedGame ? [{ key: 'continue', label: 'Continue' }] : []),
    // ... other items
];
```

## 🚀 Testing

The system has been thoroughly tested:
- ✅ Team selection from fresh start
- ✅ New game creation with team assignment
- ✅ Screen state persistence across app restarts
- ✅ Menu adaptation based on save state
- ✅ Game resume functionality
- ✅ Save cleanup when starting new games

## 📈 What's Next

This foundation makes it easy to add:
- **Player Management** - Draft, trade, and develop players
- **Season Simulation** - Game-by-game progression
- **Advanced Stats** - Detailed performance tracking
- **Multiple Save Slots** - Support for multiple concurrent games
- **Team Customization** - Modify team attributes and strategies

The hybrid database approach and persistent state management provide a solid foundation for expanding into a full baseball management simulation!

**The game now provides a complete, persistent experience from team selection through ongoing management! 🎯⚾**
